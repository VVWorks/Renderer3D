# Renderer3D
  An open source, build from scratch, 3D renderer that takes 3D data and convert it to screen space.
It is not designed for very serious projects, it will fail at performance. It's purpose is learning how an 3D API handles data. 
Using it you can learn about matrix projection, rotation, cameras, meshes, clipping, texturing and inputs.
  However, the renderer fits well for small 3D projects with low poly meshes. Feel free to use it how you like but keep in mind that it's base purpose it learning.
