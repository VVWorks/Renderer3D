# Renderer3D
  An open source, build from scratch, 3D renderer that takes 3D data and converts it to screen space.
It is not designed for very serious projects, it will fail at performance. Its purpose is learning how an 3D API handles data. 
Using it you can learn about matrix projection, rotation, cameras, meshes, clipping, texturing and inputs. The renderer fits well for small 3D projects with low poly meshes. Feel free to use it how you like but keep in mind that it's base purpose it learning.


# Overview
This does not feature something new and every technique in this project is commonly used in 3D APIs. Before jumping in the code i recommend watching this youtube series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih20l3pJoeU it explains very well the math and concepts behind an 3D API. Some of the functions used here are based from this tutorial as well. After learning about 3D rendering you can implement it yourself and you'll see it will look very similar to this project, in fact it should look and behave similar to the majority of 3D renderers.
